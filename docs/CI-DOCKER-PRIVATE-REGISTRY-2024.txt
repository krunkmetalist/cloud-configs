We now have a private docker registry, which mitigates the need to pay Docker hub 7 dollars a month, woot.

A registry is where we keep our proprietary images that contain sensitive information.
Here we can push & pull images within the safety of our network.

The details:

- ssh to the host

- Host:

    - when on the host, at a prompt:

        docker push|pull localhost:5050/<image-name>:<version-tag>

    - still working on remote access

How to make one:

- create a volume
    
    docker volume create <vol-name>

- pull down the image

    docker pull registry

- run the image in a container

    docker run -d --name registry --mount src=<vol-name>,dst=/var/lib/registry -p <free-port>:5000 registry

- push an image

    docker push localhost:<free-port>/php:mysqli

- pull an image

    docker pull localhost:<free-port>/php:mysqli

- query the repo

    curl http://localhost:<free-port>/v2/_catalog
